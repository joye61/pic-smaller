# Pic Smaller (图小小)

**Pic Smaller** is a super easy-to-use online image compression tool. It's intuitive, mobile friendly, and supports compression configuration. At the same time, because of purely local compression without any server-side logic, it is completely safe.

## Usage

Pic smaller has been deployed to [`vercel`](https://vercel.com/), you can use it by visiting the URL [pic-smaller.vercel.app](https://pic-smaller.vercel.app). Due to the GFW, Chinese users can use it by visiting the URL [picsmaller.com](https://picsmaller.com/)

> [picsmaller.com](https://picsmaller.com/) is a new domain that has just been applied for. The old domain [txx.cssrefs.com](https://txx.cssrefs.com/) is still accessible, but will be expired on `2025-02-22` and payment will not continue. Please use the latest domain to access the service.

## Develop

Pic smaller is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) project, you have to get familiar with them first. It uses modern browser technologies such as `OffscreenCanvas`, `WebAssembly`, and `Web Worker`. You should also be familiar with them before developing.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/joye61/pic-smaller.git

# Change cwd
cd ./pic-smaller

# Install dependences
npm install

# Start to develop
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

If you want to independently deploy this project on your own server, the following document based on Docker, follow the instructions to start docker application

```bash
# Pull docker image from ghcr.io
docker pull ghcr.io/joye61/pic-smaller:latest

# Start a container
docker run -p 3001:3001 -d picsmaller
```

Now you can access the project via http://127.0.0.1:3001. If you want your project to be accessible to everyone, you need to prepare a domain name pointing to your local machine, and then proxy it to port 3001 of this machine, through a reverse proxy server like nginx.
